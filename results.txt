Here are the approximate number of strips you should be getting.

The "valence" of a triangle is its number of adjacent non-strip triangles.

200:

  45 strips with no optimizations
  38 strips using minimum-valence starting triangle
  15 strips using minimum-valence starting and next triangles

  (can get 2 strips using a different algorithm)

  0.32 seconds

1000:

  43 strips using minimum-valence starting and next triangles

  (can get 2 strips using a different algorithm)

  0.35 seconds

10000:

  466 strips using minimum-valence starting and next triangles

   (can get 5 strips using a different algorithm)

  1.83 seconds
